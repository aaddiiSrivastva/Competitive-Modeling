Problem
A genetic disorder is a health condition that is usually caused by mutations in DNA or changes in the number or overall structure of chromosomes. Several types of commonly-known diseases are related to hereditary gene mutations. Genetic testing aids patients in making important decisions in the prevention, treatment, or early detection of hereditary disorders.
With increasing population, studies have shown that there has been an exponential increase in the number of genetic disorders. Low awareness of the importance of genetic testing contributes to the increase in the incidence of hereditary disorders. Many children succumb to these disorders and it is extremely important that genetic testing be done during pregnancy.

Task
You are given a dataset that contains medical information of children who have genetic disorders. Predict the following:
 1. Genetic disorder 
 2. Disorder subclass
